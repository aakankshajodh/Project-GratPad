Introduction: -
In today’s era, people are giving importance to everything and everyone except themselves, and no matter how much we deny it's hard to keep up with your life when one is going through a fragile mental state or emotional state. In this digitalized world there are still a few things that people prefer to do on paper because they lack a platform where they can manage multiple tasks.
There are still many people who use diaries or books to write their thoughts out where they cannot completely open up as they constantly feel that their notes are unsafe and can be accessed by anyone so to overcome this problem and to respect one’s privacy in addition to develop one’s mindset this system is to be developed.

Existing System:
	The existing journaling is being done in the paper itself where the individual must maintain a diary or a book to write down their daily entries. This system adds an uncomforting and unsafe environment for the diarists. In addition to it, except for normal journaling, they do not get to acknowledge the world’s views and develop their mindsets accordingly. As diarists usually prefer excellent quality of diary and pens it increases the cost of goods required for journaling. 
In case they must view their journal entries the user will have to go through the complete number of diaries for one entry. Though the existing system is portable, there are high chances for the existing system to get physically damaged or lost. There is a high chance that anyone can access the diary which can cause privacy concerns. Apart from that for the regular journaling person one diary is never enough so he/she will constantly need new diaries and to keep those diaries one will require shelf which will consume space.
 





Disadvantages of Existing System:
▫	In the existing system, to go through one entry the individual will have to go through the complete diary or will have to use the traditional bookmarking system to go back to the needful entry, and just in case the required entry is in another diary then they will have to go through multiple diaries.
▫	There are high chances of physical damage like mistakenly ripping the page off, wrinkling of pages, spilling something over the diary causing stains and drenching of pages.    
▫	The individual will constantly have to change the diaries once they are full and will have to keep a track of all the diaries of past entires. 
▫	The constant use of goods required for journaling will cause amount of money. 
▫	The storage of diaries will consume space


Proposed System:
	The proposed system is the computerized version of the existing system with various updates and additions of multiple features. Just like physical fitness, our mental fitness is a necessary aspect of our life as well and we should be given a safe space to let out all that we have in our minds. And we all need to hear the motivation out when everything seems down, and we have no one to cheer us up. A journaling system a web application where people can note down their thoughts and put-up daily journal entries. Not just the journaling but an individual could go and read out daily affirmations as per the user’s choice for the times when they really want something motivating.

Feasibility study: -
•	Econmical Feasible:-
                                 As our system is computerised system so it always helpful to reduce a lots of paperwork for maintaining the individual’s records. This system is helpful to manage all the sections of the services cost to maintain it get reduced. This System has reduced paperwork and is cost efficient as everything can be done on your personal computers using our standalone application.


•	Operational Feasible:-
                                  In the existing system there is lot of written paper work. So that is very time consuming and expensive process. As  our proposed system is computerised system that will be very user friendly system. In our proposed system we used Python Web Development(Spyder) as front-end software as this is event driven programming language, it is extremely easy to operate the forms of system by user. 

•	Technical Feasible:-
                     In our proposed system we use operating system as ‘Microsoft Windows’ that can be available all the time. In this system we used back end software as ‘Django Admin’ or “MySQL(Python)” which is available on microsoft windows. In proposed system we have hardwares like LCD monitor,normal keybord and compatible mouse which are available on every pc’s. To run our system we required Python Web Development(Spyder) as front-end software which is also easily available on internet.
